# Unit Converter Tool

A user-friendly Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, designed to convert physics-related units for length, energy, and temperature. This project showcases my skills in Python programming, GUI development, and physics applications, making it ideal for educational and practical use.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI:** Uses Tkinter for an intuitive interface with dropdowns, input fields, and buttons.
- **Unit Conversions:** Supports:
  - **Length:** Meters (m), Feet (ft), Kilometers (km)
  - **Energy:** Joules (j), Watt-hours (wh), Kilojoules (kj)
  - **Temperature:** Celsius (c), Fahrenheit (f), Kelvin (k)
